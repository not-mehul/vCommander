"""
Commission Tool - GUI Component for Commissioning Verkada Organizations.

This module provides the GUI interface for adding new devices to a Verkada
organization. This tool facilitates onboarding hardware for various VCE courses.

Note: This is a placeholder/stub implementation. The full implementation
would include:
- Device claim code entry interface
- Course type selection
- Site assignment workflow
- Device configuration options
- Bulk commissioning capabilities
- Commissioning progress tracking

For now, this module exists as a structural placeholder to maintain
consistency with the other tool modules (add_user, decommission).
